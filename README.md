# Andrew's TinyApp

## Summary 

Hello there! This is my TinyApp submission, and I did my best to balance between the learning experience, following all the steps, project requirements, and time given. I did the check against every single requirement in order to make sure I'm meeting all of the musts. Sorry, if the front end is ugly, but we're not there yet :)
